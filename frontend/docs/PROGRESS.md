## Backend API Requirements

### Existing Endpoints (Ready to Use)
- ✅ `GET /health`
- ✅ `GET /health/detailed`
- ✅ `GET /devices`
- ✅ `GET /devices/{id}`
- ✅ `POST /devices/{id}/restart`
- ✅ `GET /data/latest`
- ✅ `GET /data/latest/{deviceId}`
- ✅ `GET /data/stats`

### New Endpoints Required

**Phase 3 (Configuration)**:
- ⬜ `GET /config/devices`
- ⬜ `PUT /config/devices`
- ⬜ `POST /config/devices`
- ⬜ `DELETE /config/devices/{id}`
- ⬜ `POST /config/test-connection`
- ⬜ `GET /config/database`
- ⬜ `PUT /config/database`
- ⬜ `GET /config/mqtt`
- ⬜ `PUT /config/mqtt`
- ⬜ `GET /config/apikeys`
- ⬜ `PUT /config/apikeys`
- ⬜ `GET /config/system`
- ⬜ `PUT /config/system`

**Phase 4 (Tools)**:
- ⬜ `POST /tools/network-scan`
- ⬜ `POST /tools/mqtt-discover`
- ⬜ `POST /tools/ping`
- ⬜ `POST /tools/modbus-test`

**Phase 5 (Logs)**:
- ⬜ `GET /logs`
- ⬜ `GET /logs/summary`
- ⬜ `GET /logs/export`
- ⬜ `GET /logs/live` (WebSocket/SSE)

**Phase 6 (Historical Data)**:
- ⬜ `GET /data/history/{deviceId}`

**Total New Endpoints**: 23

## Blockers & Risks

### Current Blockers
- None (Phase 1 can proceed with existing endpoints)

### Future Blockers
- **Phase 3**: Configuration endpoints needed (13 endpoints)
- **Phase 4**: Tools endpoints needed (4 endpoints)
- **Phase 5**: Logs endpoints needed (4 endpoints)
- **Phase 6**: Historical data endpoint needed (1 endpoint)

### Mitigation Strategy
- **Phase 1-2**: Build with existing endpoints
- **Backend team**: Implement configuration endpoints during Week 2-3
- **Parallel development**: Frontend mocks, backend implements real endpoints
- **Testing**: Use mock data until backend ready
