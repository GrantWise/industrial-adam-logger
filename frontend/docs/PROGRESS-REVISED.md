## Backend API Requirements

### Existing (Ready)
- ✅ `GET /health`
- ✅ `GET /health/detailed`
- ✅ `GET /devices`
- ✅ `GET /devices/{id}`
- ✅ `POST /devices/{id}/restart`
- ✅ `GET /data/latest`
- ✅ `GET /data/latest/{deviceId}`
- ✅ `GET /data/stats`

### Phase 3 Requirements (3 endpoints)
- ⬜ `POST /tools/ping`
- ⬜ `POST /tools/modbus-test`
- ⬜ `GET /logs/device/{deviceId}?limit=10`

### Phase 4 Requirements (10 endpoints)
- ⬜ `GET /config/devices`
- ⬜ `POST /config/devices`
- ⬜ `PUT /config/devices/{id}`
- ⬜ `DELETE /config/devices/{id}`
- ⬜ `POST /config/test-connection`
- ⬜ `POST /tools/network-scan`
- ⬜ `GET /config/apikeys`
- ⬜ `PUT /config/apikeys`
- ⬜ `GET /config/export`
- ⬜ `POST /config/import`

### Phase 5 Requirements (1 endpoint)
- ⬜ `GET /logs/download`

**Total New Endpoints**: 13 (reduced from 23)

## Features Summary

### ✅ Included (Balanced Approach)

**Dashboard**:
- Dense device table (all devices on one screen)
- Auto-refresh (10s polling)
- System health summary
- Critical alerts banner
- Inline troubleshooting panel
- Recent logs (last 10 per device)
- Test buttons (ping, Modbus)
- 60-second live chart

**Configuration**:
- Add/Edit device forms (Modbus + MQTT)
- Network scanner (find devices on LAN)
- API Keys management (hot-reload)
- Advanced: Download/upload JSON

**Libraries**:
- shadcn/ui (team knows it)
- Tailwind CSS (team knows it)
- Recharts (simple live charts only)
- React Query (server state)

### ❌ Removed (Over-Engineering)

- Full logs tab → Use inline recent logs instead
- Historical charts → Link to Grafana
- MQTT discovery modal → Document CLI usage
- Database/MQTT broker config forms → Download/upload JSON
- Monaco/CodeMirror editor → Download/edit/upload
- WebSocket real-time → Polling sufficient
- Zod validation → Native HTML5 validation

---

## Blockers & Risks

### Current Blockers
- None (Phase 1-2 use existing endpoints)

### Future Blockers
- **Phase 3 (Week 3)**: Need tools + logs endpoints
- **Phase 4 (Week 4)**: Need config management endpoints

### Mitigation
- Mock responses in Phase 1-2
- Backend implements endpoints in parallel (Week 2-3)
- Integration testing Week 4-5

---

## Timeline

| Week | Phase | Focus | Backend Dependency |
|------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| 1 | Foundation | Setup, routing, API client | None |
| 2 | Dashboard | Device table, health, alerts | None |
| 3 | Troubleshooting | Inline panel, logs, chart | Tools + logs endpoints |
| 4 | Configuration | Forms, network scan, API keys | Config endpoints |
| 5 | Polish | Testing, docs, performance | None |

**Total: 5 weeks**

## Design Decisions (Toyota + User Empathy)

### Kept (User Value)
- Inline troubleshooting (no context switch)
- Forms for common operations (user-friendly)
- Team's existing stack (developer velocity)
- 60s live chart (verify commissioning)
- Network scanner (find devices fast)

### Removed (Duplicate/Bloat)
- Full logs tab (use inline + download)
- Historical charts (use Grafana)
- Complex config forms (use download/upload)
- Heavy editors (use local tools)

### Balanced
- Use shadcn/ui + Tailwind (team knows it)
- Forms for device config (weekly operation)
- Download/upload for DB config (rare operation)
- Simple validation (native HTML5)

---

- ✅ Dashboard shows all devices in one table (Modbus + MQTT)
- ✅ Real-time updates work (10s polling via React Query)
- ✅ Status indicators visible (StatusIndicator component)
- ✅ Critical alerts displayed (auto-hide when none)

**Phase 3 Complete When**: ✅ ALL COMPLETE
- ✅ Expand device → See inline troubleshooting
- ✅ Test ping + Modbus works
- ✅ Recent logs show last 10 entries
- ✅ 60s live chart works
- ✅ Restart device works

**Phase 4 Complete When**:
- ✅ Add device via form < 2 minutes
- ✅ Network scan finds devices
- ✅ API keys manageable (hot-reload)
- ✅ Download/upload config works

**Phase 5 Complete When**:
- ✅ No console errors
